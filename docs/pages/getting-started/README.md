1. Install promise-tracker.  You have three choices:
  * Bower: `bower install ajoslin/angular-promise-tracker`
  * Git: `git clone git://github.com/ajoslin/angular-promise-tracker`
  * Copy/paste: Go to the repo and have fun.
2. Include the promise-tracker script after your index.html
3. Include the `ajoslin.promise-tracker` module as a dependency for your app:
```
angular.module('myApp', ['ajoslin.promise-tracker']);
```
4. Finally, create a promiseTracker and put it on your scope. Jolly good!
